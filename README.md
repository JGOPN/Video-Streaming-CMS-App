This is an Android App that acts as a Contenta Management System. It allows admins to upload movies to the remote server, from local files or web URLS, as well as deleting movies and managing users. 
It uses Google's modern Jetpack Compose libraries for UI, and tries to follow modern Android architecture conventions.
